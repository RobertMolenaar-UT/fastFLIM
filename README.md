## Discription
The main purpose of the fastFLIM script is one can convert batchwise multiple PTU files or a folder with PTU files and get a series Fluorescent fastFLIM images with minimal user input. This is usefull for screening results during imaging and to be used in presentations. FastFLIM calculates the average arrival time, which is a fast method to get a fluorescent lifetime information for image with low photon counts per pixel, which is typical for TCSPC methods. 

## Dependencies
The script is developed and tested on Python 3.11, Install:
	- wx python 4.2.1 for the file selector app.
	- imageIO
	- matplotlib-scalebar 
	- PTU file reader: https://github.com/RobertMolenaar-UT/readPTU_FLIM (updated version inlcuded)

## Scripts features:  
- File Check, if it is a 2D  image.
- Autodetects the number of APD channels. 
- Supports 'normal' and 'PIE' excitation, one can set channel Timegate.
- fastFLIM/rapidFLIM Conversion.
- Optional: Image pixel binning.
- Optional: Clean TIF images and datafiles are stored.
- File-errors are catched and reported in the end.

## Modification to your your MT200:

1.  Change the laser lines in order of the SEPIAII rackposition *PDL828_laser_line=[638,560,488,405]*. If lasers are in installed in different SEPIAII rack positions assign these in *def Read_laserLines()*  PDL828_module=[200,300,400,500]  #names of the lasers modules in ptu headerfile of rack position [2,3,4,5] 	
2.  Set the objective full name in Symphotime64 application or in the function *Read_objective()*

## Usage: 

Put the 2D_PicoQuant_fastFLIM.py and readPU_FLUM_bidirect.py files in the sample folder, preferable with you data. The File readPTU_FLIM_bidirect is modified from https://github.com/RobertMolenaar-UT/readPTU_FLIM and expanded with bidirection line-offset correction. pixles shift correction is set by *bi-direct* variable.

1. Set the Channel configuration according optical setup.

	>Detector Channels need to be configured:
	Config1 = Set_Channel_Info(1,
	                           'Namelabel',
	                           Brighter=1.2,
	                           PIE_TimeGate=1,
	                           ch_irf=2.55)
	>1. *Namelabel*: name of the used dye or sample.
	>2. *Brigther*: 	intensity is maximum scaled, increasing brightness helps visibility.
	>3. *PIE TimeGate*: Contrast can be enhanced by using Pulsed Interlieved Excitation in the measurment to supress any cross-excitation. 
	>4. *ch_irf*: instrument response, channel specific time offset.
	
2. Read and set all options in the section --- USER input---  upon description.
3. Run 2D_PicoQuant_fastFLIM.py.
4. Note the pop-up window in the taskbar and browse and select the PTU files.
5. Next the *.PTU files are proccessed, and images are shown in the command line. (for large PTU file size it can take time to proccess)
6. Images and data files are saved in folder /Python_converted_* Username* /
7. Errors on files are listed in the end.

>The countrate in FLIM should not exceed 20%, *FLIM_sync_limit* shows the 20% count value per pixel.

## OUTPUT

1. Summary Intensity plus FLIM image. *Figure1*
2. optional *clean_imsave*, saves a clean, FLIM and Intensity TIF file for each channel.
3. optional *Save_data_files*, saves a csv data of intensity and Tavg lifetimes.



## Known limitations: 

1. Files sizes > 1GB use a lot of Memory. 64GB or higher is recommended for 1GB PTU files. 
2. Multiframe PTU conversion appears to skip a Frame, modification needed in the readPTU_FLIM code. aug '24

Script is used on a Picoquant MT200 with FLIMBEE laserscanner with 4x SPAD detectors and a multiharp 150N.
v1.0 - 1 August 2024 Robert Molenaar Â©.



## Workflow summary
 
1.  wx 'GUI_select_Multi_file' app prompts to select (multiple) *.PTU files. 
2.  The main For-loop proccesses all files sequentially.
3.  The PTU file is read by "ptu_file  = PTUreader((path), print_header_data = False)"
4.  File is checked if it's a 2D image file:
5.  The PTU file is converted "flim_data_stack, intensity_image = ptu_file.get_flim_data_stack()"
6.  FLIM data stack is checked for avaialbe channels 'ch_list, ch_listst=Channels_list(flim_data_stack)'
7.  Option: with pixel binning set to 2 or higher, FLIM data stack is reshaped.
8.  If 'PIE'exication is used, Timegates are calcualted.
9.  For each channel, FLIM data is converted for the current channel and timegates from the FLIM data stack
10. For each channel, Colour map is applied on the FLIM data, based on the Tau min & max.
11. Option. Tav and intensity csv data is saved.
12. Figure is plotted.
13. Option  FLIM image and Intensity tif image is saved.
14. Option, FLIM images from multiple channels can be overlapped by overlap_FLIMchannels.
